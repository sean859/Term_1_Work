# This is the merge sort algorithm consiting of two functions

# This function essentially breaks the full unsorted list up into two sublists, with it being an even amount in each list
# if its an odd number list then it will place the extra value in the sublist named 'left', once the sublist have been created
# it sends those sublists to the main merge function above labeled as 'left' and 'right'
def mergesort(lst):
    if(len(lst) <= 1): # This will get a new variable called 'mid' that is the value in the very middle (rounded up), and placing all

# Then this last bit of code will call the mergesort function and assign it the list we have, being 'Agedata' which is just
